## The Site
This site is intended to host technical write-ups, personal projects, and detailed solutions to problems I've encountered. While the majority of posts will be centered around C#, ASP.NET Core, and SQL, I enjoy challenging myself with new and unfamiliar technologies; particularly in the artificial intelligence and machine learning space. As such, the content of this site may vary on occasion to cover other languages or tools outside of the .NET ecosystem.

While hopefully others will find this information valuable in their own troubles, it should be understood that this is a perpetual work-in-progress and a hobby. I'm always open to suggestions: if there's something I've overlooked, or a topic you would like me to write on, feel free to reach out.
