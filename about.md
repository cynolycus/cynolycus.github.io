In the meantime, please be patient and let me know any constructive criticism or suggestions on making this space better! For the time being, I'm focusing on removing some clutter and cleaning up the internal workings of the site. Keep checking back for updates!

### The Site
This site is intended to host technical write-ups, personal projects, and detailed solutions to problems I've encountered. While the majority of posts will be centered around SQL, C#, and ASP.NET Core, I enjoy challenging myself with new and unfamiliar technologies. As such, the content of this site may vary on occasion to cover other languages or tools outside of the .NET ecosystem.
